# Minimal_timer
A simple and minimal timer to organize the study time with two distinct timings for  rest and study. 
In addition, the two modes can be either **manually** by the user or **automatically** according to the **"Pomodoro technique" (25 min of study and 5 min of break)**

# Feature
1) **SIMPLE and MINIMAL**: a simple and minimal style that allows you to focus and avoid distractions while you're studying
2) **POMODORO friendly**: _The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student._ [source: Wikipedia]
3) **HIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE**: before the timer start, it asks you if you want to set it manually the **study_time** and the **relax_time** or automatically according to **Cirillo's Pomodoro technique**.
